Answer 1:  Slow solution 

select e.name as "Employee"
from Employee e
where e.Salary > ( select Salary 
                   from Employee
                   where Id=e.ManagerId)

Answer 2:  fast solution 
	   SELECT a.Name AS "Employee"
           FROM Employee a JOIN Employee b ON
                         a.ManagerId = b.Id AND
                         a.Salary > b.Salary
Q12) Duplicate Emails

+----+---------+
| Id | Email   |
+----+---------+
| 1  | a@b.com |
| 2  | c@d.com |
| 3  | a@b.com |
+----+---------+
For example, your query should return the following for the above table:
+---------+
| Email   |
+---------+
| a@b.com |
+---------+

ANSWER:     SELECT Email
            FROM Person 
            ROUP BY Email

| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+
Id is the primary key column for this table.
For example, after running your query, the above Person table should have the following rows:

+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
+----+------------------+
Note:
