Arrays.sort(a,k,a.length); 

Continuous Subarray Sum . (Check for k==0)

Subarray Sum Equals K
        for case int a2[] = {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0};
            int k2 = 0;

Doing int mid = (lo + hi) / 2; is prone to overflow. Instead int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2
Adding two integers = conside max and min int value.
